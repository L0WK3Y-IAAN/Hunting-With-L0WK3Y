Welcome to the **Projects 🧪** page of "Hunting with L0WK3Y"! Here, you'll find a showcase of the tools, scripts, and experiments I've created or contributed to during my bug bounty journey. Each project represents a step forward in my mission to uncover vulnerabilities, enhance security, and grow as a cybersecurity professional.  

## What's Featured  

- **Custom Tools**: Scripts and utilities tailored to automate repetitive tasks, improve reconnaissance, and streamline vulnerability testing.  

- **Proof of Concepts (PoCs)**: Demonstrations of exploit techniques and how they can be used to validate vulnerabilities responsibly.  
  
- **Innovative Ideas**: Experimental projects and concepts designed to push the boundaries of traditional bug hunting.  

## Why Explore This Page?  
Each project comes with detailed explanations, usage instructions, and, when possible, the thought process behind its creation. These projects are not only practical for bug bounty hunting but also serve as a learning resource for anyone interested in ethical hacking and security research.
