## The Challenge

This application requires a PIN code to provide you with the key. However, without knowing the PIN, you will not be able to retrieve the key.

There are two ways to get around this:

- The first way is to use [**apktool**](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/) like you did before. **`apktool`** will extract the application's code as **`Smali`** code. Then you will be able to browse the source code in the **`Smali`** directory (it's not very intuitive, however, it's enough to solve this exercise).
- The second way is to extract the application yourself using **`unzip`**. From there, you should see a file named **`classes.dex`**. You can then use the tool [**dex2jar**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dex2jar/) to convert the **`dex`** file to a **`jar`** file. Once this is done, you can either **`unzip`** the **`jar`** file to browse the code or use [**jd-gui**](https://github.com/java-decompiler/jd-gui/releases).

By inspecting the **`Smali`** code or the **`Java`** code, you should be able to find the key to solve this exercise.

In this challenge, the key is printed in plain-text right in the `onCreate` of `MessageActivity`

```jsx
protected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle bundle) {
        super.onCreate(bundle);
        setContentView(R.layout.message);
        this.message = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.message);
        getIntent().getExtras().getString("pin");
        showMessage("The key is: \nREDACTED");
    }
```
