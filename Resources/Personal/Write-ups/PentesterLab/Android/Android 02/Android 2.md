## The Challenge

This application requires a PIN code to provide you with the key. However, without knowing the PIN, you will not be able to retrieve the key.

The way to solve this exercise is to extract the content of the **`APK`** (using [**apktool**](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/) for example) to get the configuration files of the application. Once you manage to extract the **`APK`**, you will find multiple files. It's always important to check for files ending with **`.db`** or **`.sqlite`** to see what information is shipped with the application. By reviewing these files, you should be able to find the key to solve this exercise.

In MainActivity there is a reference to an asset called `data.sqlite` in this file contains the flag string.

```jsx
    protected void onCreate(Bundle bundle) {
        try {
            InputStream open = getApplicationContext().getAssets().open("data.sqlite");
            FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream(getApplicationContext().getApplicationInfo().dataDir + "/databases/data.sqlite");
```
